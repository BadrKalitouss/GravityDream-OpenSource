Subject: Open Source License Request — Gravity Dream (Unity Prototype)

Hello JetBrains Team,

I'm requesting access to the JetBrains All Products pack for the open-source project "Gravity Dream" hosted publicly on GitHub.

Project: Gravity Dream — Open Source Physics Playground
Repository: <PLACE_REPO_URL_HERE>
Description:
- Unity 2D prototype demonstrating gravity flipping, basic physics, collision detection, and movement mechanics.
- Purpose: educational prototype and starting point for a larger open-source game development effort.
- License: MIT

This repository is actively maintained and public. Access to JetBrains tools (Rider, IntelliJ, WebStorm, CLion, etc.) will greatly help accelerate development and testing across the project.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Badr
